**Description**:

**Physical Characteristics**:

**Stems**: The stems are woody and thick at the base, transitioning to thinner, softer growth at the top. They are ribbed with distinct, swollen lines that run the length of the stem. Numerous small side branches grow from the main stems.

**Leaves**: The plant's soft, feathery leaves are finely divided, resembling fern fronds. The upper surface is a dark green, while the undersides and stems are covered with small white hairs, giving the entire shrub a characteristic grey-green appearance.

**Flowers**: The flowers are inconspicuous, pale yellow, and grow in drooping clusters.

**Aroma**:

A very typical characteristic of A. afra is its strong, sticky, sweet smell. This aroma is particularly noticeable when the plant is touched or cut.

**Origin and distribution**

Artemisia afra is a common species in South Africa with a wide distribution in all provinces of South Africa except the Northern Cape. It also grows wild in Lesotho, Swaziland and northwards into tropical Africa. 

**Climate and soil requirements**

Artemisia afra thrives in temperate and subtropical climates, growing best in regions where annual rainfall exceeds 650mm. It prefers well-drained soils: sandy, sandy loam, or loam types, with an optimal pH range between 5.0 and 7.5.

**Planting and seeding**

Achieving a healthy crop of African wormwood (Artemisia afra) starts with proper planting. To ensure a good plant density, a spacing of 30 cm between plants within a row and 60 cm between the rows is recommended. This setup will give you a density of approximately 55,000 plants per hectare.

When seeding, it is crucial to place the seeds at a shallow depth of just 5 mm below the soil surface. After sowing, using a roller to gently firm the soil will help enhance germination and improve the emergence of new seedlings.

**Propagation**

Artemisia afra is a versatile plant that can be easily propagated from existing plants, primarily through cuttings. The two most common and effective methods are:

**Stem Cuttings**: Select healthy, non-flowering stems from a mature plant. Cut them into 10-15 cm sections, remove the lower leaves, and plant them in a well-draining soil mix. Keep the soil moist and the cuttings in a warm, sheltered spot until new roots have formed.

**Root Cuttings**: You can also propagate the plant by carefully dividing the root system of a mature plant. Dig up the plant and gently separate it into smaller sections, each with a portion of the root and stem. Replant these sections to establish new plants.

**Preparation Methods**

Dosage Forms of African Wormwood (Artemisia afra)
Artemisia afra is a versatile herbal remedy, and its medicinal properties can be accessed through several traditional dosage forms, which are used both internally and externally.

**Oral and Topical Use**:

The primary dosage form is an aqueous decoction or infusion, which is essentially a tea made from the plant's leaves.

**Oral**: The decoction or infusion is consumed orally to treat various ailments. Can be mixed with honey to make it more palatable.

**Topical**: The same decoction or infusion can also be used externally for applications such as bathing wounds or other skin conditions.

**Inhalation**:

Another common method for using A. afra is through inhalation, which is particularly effective for respiratory issues.

Steam Inhalation: Fresh leaves are added to a pot of boiling water. The resulting vapor is then inhaled to help clear nasal congestion and soothe the respiratory tract.

**Safety considerations**:

•	Avoid during pregnancy. 
•	Do not exceed 2 weeks of continuous use.
•	Skin test first (some report contact dermatitis).
