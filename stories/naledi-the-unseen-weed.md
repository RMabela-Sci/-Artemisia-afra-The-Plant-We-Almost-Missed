## Naledi and the unseen weed

Naledi hated chores. Not with fire-breathing rage, but a soft, simmering apathy. Yardwork especially, the dust made her sneeze, the broom made her arms ache, and the weeds were endless. So when Grandpa leaned on his cane and asked gently, “Please sweep the yard today, my girl,” she sighed and dragged herself out.

The sun beat down as she hacked at dry leaves and tugged at tangled roots. Her eyes skipped over the small green bush near the fence, mistaking its feathery leaves for an invader. “Weeds,” she muttered, yanking it out, unaware that she was removing the medicine nestled in the soil. She tossed the plant aside, too tired to notice its scent, a sharp herbal aroma that lingered briefly before vanishing into the dust.

Two days later, Naledi was curled up on the couch, nose red, coughing like an old tractor. “No steam, Grandpa,” she pleaded as he warmed the kettle. “I hate steam.”

Grandpa smiled. “Tea it is, then. Artemisia Afra will fix you quick.”

He stepped out to gather the fresh leaves: 4 tablespoons for the boil, 15 minutes steeping. But the fence was bare. The soil, disturbed. No sign of his healing bush.

Frowning, he went inside and returned with his potted Afra plant, the backup he kept for stubborn flu seasons. He held it up.

“What’s this?” he asked.

Naledi blinked. “Your favorite potted plant.”

Grandpa nodded slowly. “Yes. The one that has healed you since you were six. You chopped its twin down.”

Her brows furrowed. “No. I would never—”

“Look closer.”

She leaned in, tracing the frilly leaves, the delicate silvery fuzz, the earthy scent.

“I saw it in the yard,” she whispered, realization dawning.

“That plant,” Grandpa said, “never asked for attention. It simply sat and healed. Until someone mistook it for a weed.”
