## Thandi and the healer

Thandi had a talent for daydreaming. While others saw the world in tasks and to-do lists, she saw it in swirling patterns of cloud formations, the imagined stories of ants on a mission, and the silent conversations of the wind rustling through the leaves. Unfortunately, this meant her attention to daily chores was often, to put it mildly, lacking.

One sunny Saturday, her Grandpa handed her a broom and a dustpan. "Thandi," he said with a smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes, "I need your help. The yard needs a good sweep, and the weeds are getting a bit wild by the old water tank. You can get that done for me, can't you?"

Thandi nodded, her mind already drifting to the new graphic novel she wanted to read. She started sweeping with a halfhearted motion, shuffling the broom more than using it. She made her way to the water tank, where a thick patch of what she deemed "weeds" was growing. The plants had feathery, grayish-green leaves and a distinct, almost camphor-like scent that tickled her nose. Without a second thought, she began to pull them up. It was a messy, mindless job, and she was happy to be done with it. She tossed the uprooted plants onto the ever-growing pile of yard waste, dusted off her hands, and went inside to find her book.

A few days later, a nasty cold settled in. It started with a tickle in her throat and progressed to a deep, chest-rattling cough. She lay in bed, miserable, as Grandpa came in with a steaming bowl of water, a towel, and a small, hopeful smile. "I'll make you a steam inhalation," he said gently. Thandi shook her head, already knowing the ritual. She hated the feeling of the hot, wet towel over her face.

Grandpa sighed knowingly. "Alright, alright. I know you prefer the tea. Let me go fetch some leaves."

He headed outside to his cherished Artemisia afra plant. It was his go-to for everything such as colds, flu, and a myriad of other ailments. Heâ€™d taught her that it was a gift from the earth, and he tended it with the utmost care. But when he got to the spot by the water tank, his heart sank. The place where the plant once stood was bare, save for a few stray roots. It was gone. He looked at the pile of yard waste and saw the unmistakable feathery leaves poking out from the heap. His shoulders drooped.

He went back inside, not with a handful of fresh leaves, but with a different kind of Artemisia, his treasured potted plant that lived in the sunroom. He placed it on the table next to Thandi's bed.

"Thandi," he began, his voice soft but firm. "Do you know what this is?"

She peered at the plant, its beautiful gray-green leaves a comforting presence. "That's your favourite potted plant, Grandpa."

"And you know what it's for?"

"It's... for keeping you company? It makes the room smell nice?" she offered, her voice scratchy from the cough.

Grandpa smiled, but there was a sadness in his eyes. "This plant, Thandi, and the one that used to grow outside by the tank, is what has been healing you from your cold."

Thandi's eyes widened in disbelief. "What? No, Grandpa, I would never cut down your favourite plant! I just cleaned up the weeds."

He didn't get angry. He just asked her to look closer. "Tell me what you see. Describe the character of the plant."

She leaned in, really seeing it for the first time. "The leaves are soft, like feathers... and they're a misty green color. And the smell... it's a bit spicy, a bit sweet, a bit like medicine." She paused, a flash of recognition crossing her face. The scent was exactly the same as the "weeds" she had pulled up just a few days ago.

Grandpa nodded. "It's a plant for healing, my dear. The very same one you mistook for a weed."

Thandi looked from the potted plant to the open window, her cheeks flushing with shame. She had been so caught up in her own world that she had uprooted a source of her own well-being, the very plant her Grandpa relied on. She realized that sometimes, the most important things in life aren't flashy or obvious; they are quiet, and they require you to pay attention. She had learned a hard lesson, but it was a lesson taught with love, right there in the gentle presence of the potted Artemisia.
