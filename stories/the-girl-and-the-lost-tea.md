## The Girl, the Plant & the Lost Tea: A Narrative Lab Story

Once upon a garden path, where sweeping meant daydreaming and chores felt like a storm on a sunny day, lived a girl who never truly watched where her broom wandered. One slow morning, Grandpa handed her the broom and sent her out to sweep the yard. Annoyed, she swatted carelessly at the “mess”—plucking and uprooting a fragrant, bushy plant she deemed a weed.

Days later, as a cough took root and the cold made her shiver, Grandpa shuffled outside with a mug and memory in tow: “Let's get those leaves for your Artemisia Tea,” he said. But there was nothing in the garden but neatness! Sighing, Grandpa reached for his potted Artemisia Afra, holding it up to her:

Grandpa: “What do you see?”
Girl: “That’s your favorite potted plant.”
Grandpa smiled, “It’s what you’ve been sipping each time you’re sick. You cut it down thinking it was a weed.”
Girl, wide-eyed, looked closely: silvery leaves, tall stems, bittersweet aroma. “No, that can’t be! I would never...”
Grandpa: “Look twice…and you’ll see the healer in your midst.”
